# Data Samples
Two types of instruments were used for data collection. The WLI data were acquired using Video Endoscope EG-760Z and EG-760R (Fujifilm); the LCI data were acquired using ELUXEO™ system (video processor VP-7000, light source BL-7000). All images have a resolution of 1280 × 1024.

The IM and GA in these images were annotated by radiologists in the center. The labelling results were validated using biopsy examination results.
